# 1.0 Light Shine - a Micro Consulting Platform
Quora/Stack Overflow meets Uber in a nutshell. A micro-consulting platform, which enables sharing of knowledge between experts and question askers. Question askers get questions answered for a fee (e.g $1, because small questions take less roughly a minute to answer - translates to consulting at $60/hr), and experts get this fee upon answering the question. A user can be an expert, a question asker or both. 

**A quick run down of how the app works**
  * Users can register as experts in a certain field OR none if their intention is solely to be a question asker
  * Users can post a question related to a particular field
  * Users who are experts in a field get notifications about questions asked in their fields, and they can choose to answer      these questions. Once they answer a question they get their fee ( e.g. $1)
