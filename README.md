# Micro Consulting Platform
This is app is a quora-like micro-consulting platform, with the unique feature of having experts answer questions for a small fee e.g ($1). It connects question askers and experts. The questions require short answers hence Micro Consulting!

A quick run down of how the app works
* Users can register as experts in a certain field OR none if their intention is solely to ask questions
* Users can post a question related to a particular field
* Users who are experts in a field get notifications about questions asked in their fields, and they can choose to answer these questions. Once they answer a question they get their fee ( e.g. $1)
